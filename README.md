# SDS (Simple Dataset Syndication)

SDS is a simple protocol/standard/specification for describing datasets.  It 
should be pubished alongside datasets so taht consumers of the datasets 
(both human and machines) can understand the metadata of the dataset in a
standard way.

## NOT EVEN A DRAFT

This is just an idea at the moment.  We want to create a community
around this idea and help make it a real standard.

## What are Datasets?

Datasets are any structured, non-API sources of data.  For example:

* CSV file
* JSON feed
* RSS feed
* XML document
* Shapefile
* ??

This needs more definition.  It is difficult to determine where
an API begins and a data feed ends.
